## 📦 Dataset

- **File Name:** `netflix_titles.csv`
- **Rows:** 8807
- **Columns:** 12
- **Source:** [Kaggle Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- ✅ Handles missing values (`fillna`)
- ✅ Removes duplicate rows
- ✅ Standardizes text data (like country names)
- ✅ Rename columns headers to lowercase & remove spaces
- ✅ Converts date formats to `dd-mm-yyyy`
- ✅ Cleans data types (e.g., `date_added` as datetime)

## 🧹 Cleaning Steps Overview

1. Loaded dataset with `pandas.read_csv()`
2. Identified and filled missing values with `'Unknown'`
3. Removed duplicate entries
4. Stripped extra spaces and standardized values (e.g., `USA`, `UK`)
5. Converted `date_added` to datetime and formatted as `dd-mm-yyyy`
6. Exported the cleaned dataset to `Cleaned_Netflix.csv`
